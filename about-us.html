The name of the accommodation is (TAMAN SOGRA AMBARA SIDHI GUEST HOUSE), which is located in a rural area and is the first guesthouse built by the local community. Although it is still under development, it is already suitable for those who wish to stay here. The guesthouse is made of local wood and is built near the Mount Agung climbing area, about 10 minutes from the starting point of the climb. This guesthouse is located at the foot of Mount Agung, about 3 km before the starting point of the climb, which is located in the hamlet of Sogra, Sebudi Village, Selat District, Karangasem, Bali. The purpose of building this guesthouse is to provide a place to rest and make it easier for climbers who want to climb to stay close to Mount Agung and get enough rest before climbing. They built this place in a rural area far from residential areas and air pollution, as its location is close to the forest, making it comfortable, safe, quiet, and cool.
